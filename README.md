# Braunian Noise

To all that want to take a look at this repository, welcome!

It contains the source code to my personal blog / website, which will serve as my
own broadcasting station to add to the vast noise that is called the internet.

The blog's main topics will, most likely, include:
 * Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
 * 3D & 2D Design
 * Books
 * Music
 * Programming in general
 * Lots of other stuff.

Hopefully it will provide some knowledge and entertainment to a handful of people, or more!
