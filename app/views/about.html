	<h2> About this Website </h2>
	This website / blog is where I put all of my thoughts, advice and creations 
	that I want to show to the world. In general its contents will follow 
	my own interests, which are, among many other subjects:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
		<li>Data Science</li>
		<li>Human-Computer Interaction</li>
		<li>The internet and website design</li>
		<li>3D Design</li>
		<li>2D Design</li>	
		<li>Programming in general</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What's in a Name?</h3>
	The name of this site, Braunian Noise, 
	is a wordplay on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_noise">Brownian Noise</a>, 
	a type of noise that is characterized by more low than high frequencies. 
	It sounds like a waterfall, or distant traffic and is generally regarded to be more pleasing to the ear 
	than noise with a higher high frequency content (e.g. white noise). 
	
	<h3>How it's Made</h3>
	This, still relatively simple, website has been made within the AngularJS and the Bootstrap framework.
	Besides serving as my personal business card to the outside world on the internet, it is also used as a testbed for my own code.
	It will therefor be under constant development, so checkout my page regularly for new and fancy updates!
